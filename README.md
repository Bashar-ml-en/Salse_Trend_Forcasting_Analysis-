🧠 Sales Trend & Forecast (ARIMA)

📘 Summary
This project dives into a small daily sales dataset to uncover patterns, price sensitivity, and forecast future demand using ARIMA modeling.
📊 Highlights
Weekly Seasonality: Clear repeating sales cycles with steady growth.
Price Elasticity: Demand is price inelastic (≈ 0.28) — customers aren’t very reactive to price changes
Forecasting: ARIMA(1,1,1) predicts stable sales growth over the next year.
